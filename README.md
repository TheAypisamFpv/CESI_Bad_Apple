### 1 simple rule:
- use at least 1 thing learned during a course to play Bad Apple!! (Video and/or Sound)

# Courses
## Networking with Cisco Packet Tracer
### [Using the Programming function inside Computers](https://github.com/TheAypisamFpv/CESI_Bad_Apple/tree/cisco-packet-tracer)
- Python script to print each frames. Because this python can't open files, and you can't create `.txt` files, the whole ASCII video had to be in the python file.
- **Updated version** : now runs in real time !

## Web Project (HTML , CSS & JavaScript)
### [Using JavaScript to change text](https://github.com/TheAypisamFpv/CESI_Bad_Apple/tree/Web?tab=readme-ov-file)
- JavaScript script that change paragraphe text each frame to play Bad Apple, and plays sound.

## Graph Theory
### [Using Temporal Graph Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJBJw7phDGY)
- Implementation of a temporal graph to visualize each frame, represented as a node, with edges representing transitions between consecutive frames.

## AI
### [using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](https://github.com/TheAypisamFpv/CESI_Bad_Apple/tree/AI)
Neural networks to upscale the Bad Apple video from 48x36 to 480x360

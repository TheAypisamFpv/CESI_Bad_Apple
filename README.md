# Bad Apple Web Player

Play Bad Apple in your web browser using HTML, JavaScript, and ASCII art.

**Fun fact**: This Bad Apple implementation was used as an Easter egg in the [Projet-WEB](https://github.com/Yug0-o/Projet-WEB) project!

## Project Overview

This repository contains a simple web-based ASCII art player that:
1. Displays Bad Apple animation using ASCII characters
2. Plays synchronized audio
3. Runs directly in any modern web browser

## Components

### Web Implementation
- `Bad_Apple.html`: The main HTML file that provides the player interface
- `Bad_Apple.js`: JavaScript code that handles the animation and playback
- `Bad apple.txt`: ASCII art frames for the animation
- `Bad apple.mp3`: Audio file for synchronized playback

## How It Works

1. **ASCII Animation**: The animation is stored as ASCII text frames
2. **Audio Sync**: JavaScript code synchronizes the ASCII animation with the audio playback
3. **Web Display**: HTML and JavaScript render the ASCII art in a monospace font for proper display

## Usage

1. Make sure all four files are in the same directory:
   - `Bad_Apple.html`
   - `Bad_Apple.js`
   - `Bad apple.txt`
   - `Bad apple.mp3`

2. Simply open `Bad_Apple.html` in your web browser

3. Click the play button to start the animation with synchronized audio

## Technical Details

The web implementation uses:
- HTML5 audio for music playback
- JavaScript for animation timing and frame display
- Monospace font rendering for consistent ASCII art display
- Browser-based playback requiring no additional software or setup

Note: For best results, use a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

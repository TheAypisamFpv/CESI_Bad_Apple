# Courses

### [Using the Programming function inside Computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7dnr0aOqs)
- Python script to print each frames. Because this python can't open files, and you can't create `.txt` files, the whole ASCII video had to be in the python file.
- **Updated version** : now runs in real time !

## Web Project (HTML , CSS & JavaScript)

### üîç The Challenge
**1 simple rule:**
- Use at least one concept learned during a course to play Bad Apple!! (Video and/or Sound)

[![Networking Branch](https://img.shields.io/badge/Branch-cisco--packet--tracer-darkcyan?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/TheAypisamFpv/CESI_Bad_Apple/tree/cisco-packet-tracer)

Python script to print each frame in a Cisco Packet Tracer environment. Due to the limitations of the environment (no file operations, no text file creation), the entire ASCII video had to be embedded directly within the Python file.

# Can CESI Bad Apple!! ?

---

### 1 simple rule:
- use at least 1 thing learned during a course to play Bad Apple!! (Video and/or Sound)

# Courses
## Networking with Cisco Packet Tracer
### [Using the Programming function inside Computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7dnr0aOqs)
- Python script to print each frames. Because this python can't open files, and you can't create `.txt` files, the whole ASCII video had to be in the python file.
- **Updated version** : now runs in real time !

## Web Project (HTML , CSS & JavaScript)
### Using JavaScript to change text
- JavaScript script that change paragraphe text each frame to play Bad Apple, and plays sound.

> **JavaScript file** : https://github.com/Yug0-o/Projet-WEB/blob/dev/assets/JS/Bad_Apple.js

> **Audio file** : https://github.com/Yug0-o/Projet-WEB/blob/dev/assets/BA/Bad%20apple.mp3

## Graph Theory
### [Using Temporal Graph Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJBJw7phDGY)
*This course has barely started, and yet I've already completed it because I was bored*
- Implementation of a temporal graph to visualize each frame, represented as a node, with edges representing transitions between consecutive frames.
> **Python file** : https://github.com/TheAypisamFpv/CESI_Bad_Apple/blob/GraphTheory/node%20%26%20graph%20theory/VideoToTemporalGraph.py

## AI *(Video once all bugs are fixed)*
- Scripts for converting video frames to CSV (`videoTofeatures.py`), training neural networks (`trainNeuralNet.py`), and playing predicted outputs (`AiVideoPlayer.py`).
- Each file demonstrates a different step in the AI pipeline: data preparation, model training, and frame prediction.

### BUG TO FIX : 
- #### Memory leak when running Neural Evolution (possibly fixed by killing parrallel processes)
